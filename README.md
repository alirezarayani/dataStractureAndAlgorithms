# Data Structure And Algorithms

> ## What is data Structure?
 <p>Data structure are different ways of organizing (storing) data on your computer, that can be used effectively.</p> 
<p>Before processing the data we have to organize the data in a certain way that makes the process very efficient.</p>
<p>The efficiency and the performance of the software depends on how the data is stored, organized and grouped together during the program execution.</p>
<p>The data structure is not any programming language like C, C++, java, etc. It is a set of algorithms that we can use in any programming language to structure the data in the memory.

> ### Types of data structure

#### <p>There are two types of data structures:</p>

- primitive data structure
- non-primitive data structure

##### 1- Primitive Data structure

 </p><p>The primitive data structures are primitive data types.</p>
int, char, double,char, boolean, etc.

#### 2- Non-primitive Data structure

<p>The non-primitive data structure is divided into two types:</p>

- Linear data structure
- Non-linear data structure

### Linear Data Structure

The arrangement of data in a sequential manner is known as a linear data structure. The data structures used for this
purpose are Arrays, Linked list, Stacks, and Queues. In these data structures, one element is connected to only one
another element in a linear form.

### Non-linear data structurere

When one element is connected to the 'n' number of elements known as a non-linear data structure. The best example is
trees and graphs. In this case, the elements are arranged in a random manner.

### Data structures can also be classified as:

#### Static data structure:

<p>It is a type of data structure where the size is allocated at the compile time. Therefore, the maximum size is fixed.</p><p>

### Dynamic data structure:

<p> It is a type of data structure where the size is allocated at the run time. Therefore, the maximum size is flexible.</p>

> Major Operations
>
The major or the common operations that can be performed on the data structures are:

- **Searching** :We can search for any element in a data structure.
- **Sorting**: We can sort the elements of a data structure either in an ascending or descending order.
- **Insertion**: We can also insert the new element in a data structure.
- **Updation**: We can also update the element, i.e., we can replace the element with another element.
- **Deletion**: We can also perform the delete operation to remove the element from the data structure.
